# Distribution lists for email messages from HMS IT

*LISTSERV distribution lists for email communication, including their purpose, audience, and ownership*

## Introduction

This document provides information on the use of email distribution lists used by HMS IT. This resource is designed for HMS IT staff who utilize these distribution lists to disseminate information relevant to various groups within the HMS community.

These lists include broad community-wide groups, faculty-only lists, staff-only lists, and specialized groups. The document specifies the recipients of each list, ownership details, and key contacts for managing the list.

Distribution lists are critical tools for targeted communications. These lists help streamline the dissemination of information to appropriate groups, ensuring that messages reach the right audiences without overwhelming recipients with irrelevant content. The lists are maintained by HMS IT and, in some cases, by HMS Human Resources or other departments.
