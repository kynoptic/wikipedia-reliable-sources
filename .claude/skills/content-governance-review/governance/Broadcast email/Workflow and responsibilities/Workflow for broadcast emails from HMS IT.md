# Workflow for broadcast emails from HMS IT

*Process for email messages such as announcements, notices, and outages*

## Table of contents

## Introduction

This document aims to provide a comprehensive workflow for managing broadcast email messages. It ensures that communication is effectively coordinated, timely, and consistent.

The primary audience for this document includes service managers, project managers, and communication leads responsible for requesting, drafting, reviewing, and distributing these messages.

The workflow outlined here applies to all email messages to multiple groups at HMS or most of the HMS and HSDM community. It includes lead times, steps for drafting and approval, and exceptions for various scenarios. The document covers the roles and responsibilities of service managers, communications leads, the HMS IT Email Review Working Group, and other key stakeholders involved in the communication process.

Effective communication is critical for maintaining transparency and operational efficiency within the HMS and HSDM community. This workflow is based on best practices and committee deliberations to address the complexities of disseminating information about significant changes, service launches, and unplanned outages. The structured approach ensures that all stakeholders are aware of their roles and responsibilities, lead times are adhered to, and communication is clear and accurate. This governance framework has been developed in response to user needs and practical implementation considerations.

## Summary

The workflow document outlines the procedures for managing planned and urgent email communications to the HMS and HSDM community, such as service outages, announcements, and notices.

### Planned messages

- **Lead time** – Significant changes require early notification to the communications lead, with a minimum lead time of two weeks for planned messages and 30-60 days for new service launches.
- **Workflow** – Involves steps from initial evaluation, intake form completion, draft creation, SME review, working group review, finalization, and approval, followed by distribution.
- **Exceptions** – Smaller recipient groups, preapproved templates, and reminder messages have streamlined processes. Unplanned outages and emergency changes follow expedited workflows.

### Urgent and unplanned messages

Require a rapid response, with an expedited process for drafting, approval, and distribution to ensure timely communication about service outages or degradation.

### Roles and responsibilities

- [Service manager](https://harvardmed.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fcmdb_ci_appl_list.do%3Fsysparm_userpref_module%3D9be2dbe6dbed6700bdf336723996193b%26sysparm_query%3Doperational_status%3D1%5EEQ%26sysparm_clear_stack%3Dtrue) – Initiates communication, ensures accuracy, and handles internal outage notifications.
- **Communications lead** – Coordinates the process, drafts, edits, and sends emails, and archives documentation.
- **Communications Steering Working Group** – Reviews and proofs drafts for planned communications.
- **Communications director or delegate** – Approves the final draft, recipients, and send date.
- **HSDM representative** – Focuses on HSDM community-specific communications and approvals.

Each role has a defined fallback responsibility hierarchy to ensure continuity.

## Workflow

### Planned messages

This workflow applies to planned messages such as outages, announcements, and other notices. Use this process for significant changes requiring broadcast emails to multiple groups or most of the HMS and HSDM community.

Plan to send a message when upcoming work is expected to impact most end-users' ability to work.

#### Required lead time

Follow these lead times to ensure proper preparation and communication:

- **Planned messages** – The **service manager** must contact the **communications lead** before the change is discussed at change control and at least two weeks before the community members must know about the change.
- **New service launches** – The **project manager** must notify the **communications lead** about new service launches 30 to 60 days before the service launch.

#### Workflow exceptions

Some situations allow for exceptions to the standard workflow:

- **Smaller recipient group** – For emails targeting a smaller subset of the community, the working group review stage is skipped unless the **communications director or delegate** recommends otherwise.
- **Preapproved templates** – Messages based on preapproved templates need only be copyedited and scheduled by the **communications lead**. Review by the SME is at the communications lead’s discretion. Approval by the Communication Director or delegate is not required.
- **Reminder messages** – Reminder messages based on templates or previously approved drafts do not need approval from a **communications director or delegate**. The **service manager** or **project manager** must notify the comms lead if the reminder communication needs to be changed. The **communications director or delegate** must approve these changes.
- **Unplanned outages** – Refer to the section on unplanned outages.
- **Emergency changes** – Changes that arise outside of Change Control will follow the workflow for other expedited communications.
- Messages from VIPs – Messages from IT leadership, executive VIPs, or their representatives will follow the workflow for other expedited communications. Executive VIPs can be identified in STAT on the [Executive VIPs](https://harvardmed.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fsys_report_template.do%3Fjvar_report_id%3Df978aa0e47c9065434b4bfaf016d4321) report.

#### Planned messages workflow

Follow these steps for planned messages:

1. Initial evaluation – Before discussion at Change Control, the [service manager](https://harvardmed.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fcmdb_ci_appl_list.do%3Fsysparm_userpref_module%3D9be2dbe6dbed6700bdf336723996193b%26sysparm_query%3Doperational_status%3D1%5EEQ%26sysparm_clear_stack%3Dtrue) or application owner must confirm with the communications lead if an intake form needs to be completed.
1. **Intake** – The **service manager** or **application owner** completes the email intake form at least two weeks before the first communication is delivered.
1. First draft – The communications lead assesses the form and decides what communications are needed based on the [Guidelines for choosing the best platform for messages to the HMS community](https://hu.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/HMSITAllStaff-Internal/IT%20Internal%20documents/Communications%20governance/General/Guidelines%20for%20choosing%20the%20best%20platform%20for%20messages%20to%20the%20HMS%20community.docx?d=w009c90ff2d2f4e1aaf8ba0007e35e067&csf=1&web=1&e=NDGSDD). If needed, the communications lead drafts the email and other communications and provides a link to the draft in the change request.
1. **SME review** – The **service manager or application owner** reviews the draft for accuracy.
1. **Second draft** – The **communications lead** revises the draft if needed, then submits it for review with a response deadline.
1. **Comms Control review** – The message is presented at Comms Control for a final review by team members. By this stage, the draft has been revised for clarity by the communications team and approved for accuracy by the subject matter expert (SME). Attendees flag any remaining issues.
1. **Final draft** – The **communications lead** finalizes the draft and submits it to the **communications director** or **delegate** for approval over Teams or email.
1. **Approval** – A **communications director or delegate** reviews and approves the draft for distribution. The **Information Security & IT Compliance Officer** (Joe Zurba) can approve security-related communications. The approver notifies the communications lead of their approval over Teams or email.
1. **Distribution** – The **communications lead** finalizes formatting and links, sends the message to the recipients, and archives relevant materials.

### Urgent, unplanned messages

#### Service outages or degradation lasting more than 10 minutes require a quad-wide acknowledgment. The drafting and approval process is expedited to ensure prompt communication.

#### Unplanned outage workflow

Follow these steps for unplanned outages:

1. Intake – The [service manager](https://harvardmed.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fcmdb_ci_appl_list.do%3Fsysparm_userpref_module%3D9be2dbe6dbed6700bdf336723996193b%26sysparm_query%3Doperational_status%3D1%5EEQ%26sysparm_clear_stack%3Dtrue) notifies IT staff of the outage in the unplanned outage Teams chat channel.
1. **Confirm communications need** – The **communications lead** evaluates the scope of the outage (if the outage occurs outside of business hours, the **communications director or delegate** evaluates the scope and contacts the communications lead for help if needed). If it meets the criteria, they connect with the **service manager** to confirm communications are needed and solicit the required information for the email notification.
1. **Draft** – The **communications lead** drafts the email and any banner notifications for the website.
1. **Approval** – A **communications director or delegate** reviews and approves the draft for distribution. The communications director will flag when additional review and approval are needed from VIPs or leadership.
1. **Distribution** – The **communications lead** finalizes formatting and links, then sends the message to the recipients and archives any artifacts.

### All-clear, updates, and outage extensions

#### Provide timely updates and notifications for outage extensions and resolutions.

#### Outage extensions and updates

When an outage extends unexpectedly, follow these steps:

1. **Notification** – When an outage affecting most of the HMS community lasts longer than expected and extends by 30 minutes or more, the **service manager** will notify the **communications lead** as soon as possible.
1. **Draft** – The **communications lead** drafts the email and any banner notifications for the website.
1. **Approval** – A **communications director or delegate** or the **service manager** reviews and approves the draft for distribution. The communications director or lead will flag when additional review and approval are needed from leadership.
1. **Distribution** – The **communications lead** will email about the outage's unexpected extension.

#### All-clear

All clears are sent whenever an outage notice has been sent.

1. **Notification** – When the outage is resolved, the **service manager** will notify the **communications lead** as soon as possible and provide additional details and information about the cause of the issue, if known.
1. **Distribution** – The **communications lead** will send the email message notifying users that the outage is resolved.

### Other expedited communications

Use this workflow for emergency changes and messages from VIPs that require immediate attention:

1. Intake – The [service manager](https://harvardmed.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fcmdb_ci_appl_list.do%3Fsysparm_userpref_module%3D9be2dbe6dbed6700bdf336723996193b%26sysparm_query%3Doperational_status%3D1%5EEQ%26sysparm_clear_stack%3Dtrue) for the service affected by the emergency change or the VIP or their delegate notifies the communications lead of the needed communication and summarizes what the message needs to communicate, mainly what is being done and why, how users are affected, and any actions users must take.
1. **Confirm communications need** – The **communications lead** confirms the need for communications with a **communications director or delegate**.
1. **Draft** – The **communications lead** drafts the email and any banner notifications for the website.
1. **Approval** – A **communications director or delegate** reviews and approves the draft for distribution. The communications director will flag when additional review and approval are needed from VIPs or leadership.
1. **Distribution** – The **communications lead** finalizes formatting and links, then sends the message to the recipients and archives any artifacts.

## Smaller, team-managed communications

For communications targeting smaller group — such as project updates, notifications, or general informational messages from project managers or IT teams — a simplified workflow applies:

- **Intake** – **Team members** needing help will send the communications intake form to the communications lead.
- **Draft** – The **communications lead** will draft a message based on the intake form and send it back to the team member.
- **Editing** – The **team member** can finalize additional changes to tailor the voice, tone, and content to the team’s needs.
- **Distribution** – **Team members** are responsible for sending these messages directly. This includes regular sends from Outlook or mail merges, except when LISTSERV is used.
    - Mail merge assistance – If team members are unfamiliar with mail merge processes, the communications lead can provide [documentation](https://harvardmed.service-now.com/stat?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0011802) and guidance to build internal capacity within teams.

Project managers or team members unsure about their communication’s complexity, scale, or urgency should contact the **communications lead** for guidance on the appropriate workflow to follow.
