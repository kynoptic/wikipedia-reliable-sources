# Content guidelines for email messages to the HMS community

*Ensures effective email communications that are clear, professional, and consistent*

## Introduction

The purpose of this style guide is to provide **clear, concise, and standardized guidelines** for creating broadcast email communications for the HMS community. It is designed to ensure that all communications are **professional, easily understood, and effective** in delivering the intended message. This guide aims to help content creators and managers produce emails that are useful to our community.

This document applies to **all broadcast email communications sent by HMS IT to the HMS community**, including faculty, staff, and students. It covers various aspects of email composition, from subject lines and salutations to body content and signatures. These guidelines are intended to be used by anyone involved in the creation, review, or approval of broadcast emails within HMS IT.

Broadcast email communications are a crucial tool for disseminating important information to the HMS community. Effective communication ensures that recipients receive and understand essential updates, directives, and other messages. This style guide was developed based on best practices in content strategy and organizational communication, with input from HMS IT and other stakeholders. It aims to address common issues and improve the overall quality and consistency of our email communications.

## Content guidelines for broadcast email

### Subject line

- Use the subject line to **clearly summarize the main point of the message**. This will help the recipient determine the relevance of the email.
- If necessary, **include the date** in the subject line to indicate the urgency of the email.
- **Keep the subject line as concise as possible**. Email clients may truncate long subject lines, so it is essential to be succinct.
- **Use sentence case in the subject line**. This makes the email more readable and allows recipients to spot important proper nouns easily.
- If the message is a reminder of a previous email, **prefix the subject line with "Reminder:"**. This will let the recipient know they have not received a duplicate email by mistake.
- Avoid using the word *please* in the subject line. Instead, focus on **clearly conveying the central message of the email**.
- If the primary purpose of the email is to get the recipient to act, **include a clear and concise directive in the subject line**. Use a verb to begin the directive and, if possible, include a brief explanation.

#### Subject line examples

- Webex will be unavailable June 8-9
- Reminder: Update Zoom before May 30
- Network interruptions on June 27 impacting services
- Install CrowdStrike to protect against security risks
- Reminder: Accellion secure file-transfer tool updates
- Enroll in "Data as a Second Language" on the Harvard Training Portal

### Salutation

**Use people-first language** throughout all communications for HMS IT, including in the salutation of email messages.

- **Address the recipients as precisely as possible**. This will let them know that the message is relevant to them.
- **Begin the salutation with the main subject noun (such as *Members*, *Staff*, or *Users*)**, followed by the subject's organizational affiliation if relevant. For example, use *Dear Members of Department X* rather than *Dear Department X Members.* This format is more personal and helps to ensure consistency.
- When addressing departments, **use the full name of the department** rather than the acronym. The full name is more precise and professional.
- **Begin the salutation with *Dear*** **and end with a colon.** This is the standard format for business communications and follows what the dean of HMS uses.

#### Salutation examples

- Dear Members of the HMS and HSDM Communities:
- Dear Faculty Members of HMS:
- Dear Users of Webex at HMS and HSDM:
- Dear Faculty and Staff of the Harvard Program in Therapeutic Science (HiTS) and Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology (LSP):

### Body

#### Content priority and messaging architecture

Be brief, use plain language, and focus on what work is being done and the action the user needs to take. The primary messages should be bolded. Structure and format the message in this order:

1. The benefit of the work to users.
1. **When and what work will be done.**
1. How that work impacts users.
1. Why the user must act.
1. **The actions we recommend the user take to mitigate the impact.**

For example:

[1] To increase bandwidth across campus, [2] **HMS IT will upgrade the network on Saturday, September 26, 2020, from 6:00 AM to 1:00 PM EDT (UTC-4).**

[3] You may have trouble maintaining an internet connection during this time. [4] To limit the impact of this intermittent outage, [5] **save any work that uses an internet connection before the scheduled upgrade**.

#### Complicated messages

If an email communicates multifaceted impacts and variable recommended user actions, summarize the primary messages as previously described, then elaborate using the following structure and formats:

1. Summary
    1. The benefit of the work to users.
    1. **When and what work will be done.**
    1. How that work impacts users.
    1. Why the user must act.
    1. **The primary actions we recommend the user take to mitigate the impact.**
1. Additional actions that users must take
    1. Secondary action
    1. Tertiary action
    1. Important caveats or other helpful information
1. Elaborate on the work and the benefits
    1. Describe the problem
    1. Describe the solution
    1. Describe the outcome
1. Additional information
    1. Link to overview pages for affected services
    1. Link to relevant KB articles

### Avoid imitating phishing emails

It is essential to follow these guidelines to avoid using language and linking formats common to phishing attacks. This will help our community feel more comfortable following our directions and prevent them from acclimating to important signs of a phishing attempt.

- **Use an address familiar to recipients, and ensure** the email comes from a *@hms.harvard.edu* address.
- **Don't communicate with users about a service that they don't use**. Limit the recipients to those who actively use a service.
- **Address the user directly**. Generic salutations are more likely to be used in phishing attacks, so use *Dear First-name Last-name:* if possible.
- **Avoid URL shorteners**, as they hide the destination URL, a tactic used in phishing attempts.
- Describe the web property when linking outside of harvard.edu. For example: You can read more about this issue on [Zoom's support site](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en).
- **Link text must describe the link destination**. Avoid using phrases like *Click here.*
- **Don't mention negative consequences if a user doesn't act.** If necessary, frame these as positive results if a user *does* act.
- **Distance negative outcomes from linked calls-to-action** that the user must take. Be cautious when referring to account suspensions or revoked access.
- **Avoid requests that users take urgent action**. Plan email communications so users have at least several days to take necessary action.
- **Avoid intense language**. Avoid words like *absolutely* and *immediately.*
- **Don't include attachments**. Attachments are often used in phishing attacks, so they will make the email more suspicious.
- **Don't request that users somehow verify their accounts**. This type of language is used in phishing attacks and must be avoided.
- **Don't request credentials or passwords in emails**. When asking a user to complete a process that requires a username or password, don't mention that part of the process in emails.
- **Don't link directly to files that must be downloaded to be viewed or used**. Triggering a download with a link in an email may justifiably alarm recipients.

### Closing paragraph

Avoid combining the closing paragraph with other information. For example, if you want to reference additional resources, include them in an earlier email section, not the closing paragraph.

The closing paragraph should rarely be modified. Consistency in how we present essential contact information will make it easier for users to find help.
