*Subject line: [Summarize the update]*

Dear Members of the HMS and HSDM Communities:

[Describe the updates, starting with restored services or other news that benefit the user. Describe what the user needs to do to realize any benefits.]

[Reiterate the remaining issues and the impact on users. Describe newly identified issues and their effects on users. 

We're continuing to work to resolve this issue as quickly as possible. We'll follow up with any critical updates.

[Provide alternatives to services that are down, if available.]

## Example

*Subject line: Read-only access restored to HMS file servers*

Read-only access to the HMS file server has been restored. Sign in as usual to access any files you have stored on the server.

File uploads are still unavailable. If you are an administrator, you still can't change the permissions of files or folders.

We're working to resolve these issues as quickly as possible, and we'll follow up with any critical updates.

If you need an alternative while we address the outage, Dropbox Business may be helpful for storing files.
