Content guidelines for unplanned outage email messages to the HMS community

*Guidance on crafting clear and effective unplanned outage email communications for the HMS community*

## Introduction

This document provides a standardized template for **email communications sent to the HMS community during unplanned service outages**. The objective is to ensure that all messages are clear, concise, and empathetic, while effectively communicating the status of the outage and any relevant updates. This template is intended for use by HMS IT staff responsible for drafting and disseminating outage notifications.

The templates and guidelines within this document apply to all unplanned outage email messages sent to HMS, HSDM, and Wyss Institute communities.

Effective communication during unplanned service outages is crucial to maintain trust and transparency with the HMS community. This document was **developed and approved by the HMS IT Communications Steering Working Group**, to provide structured, empathetic, and actionable communication during disruptions. The templates focus on acknowledging the problem from the user’s perspective, offering alternative solutions where possible, and updating the community as the situation evolves. The guidance emphasizes the importance of clarity, relevance, and maintaining the community’s confidence in HMS IT’s ability to resolve issues promptly.

## Guidance

### Initial notification

When there is an unplanned outage that affects most of the HMS community, send an email acknowledging that we are aware of the problem and are working toward a resolution. These messages must focus on the impact from the user’s perspective.

These messages can be short and impersonal.

In the message, be sure to:

1. **Clearly state the issue and its impact on users.** Provide a brief description of the problem, specifying affected services and how it impacts the community.
1. **Reassure users that the issue is being addressed.** Inform users that the IT team is working on a resolution and will provide updates.
1. **Offer alternatives if available.** Suggest other services or workarounds users can utilize during the outage.
1. **Direct users to support resources.** Include links to online resources and contact information for further assistance.

Outages originating with third-party vendors – PROVISIONAL as of 2025-10-20

When an outage originates with a third-party vendor (such as AWS, Microsoft, or Zoom), HMS IT remains responsible for communicating with the HMS community. In these cases:

- **Be transparent that the outage stems from a vendor issue.**
- **Avoid implying that HMS IT is directly resolving the issue.**
- **Indicate that HMS IT is monitoring the situation and coordinating with the vendor.** Maintain accountability by explaining what HMS IT is doing — for example, “We’re in contact with the vendor and monitoring their progress.”
- Use phrasing such as:
    - “This issue originates with [vendor name]. HMS IT is monitoring their progress toward resolution and will share updates as they become available.”
    - “We’ve confirmed that this outage is caused by a [vendor] service disruption. HMS IT is working with [vendor] to keep you informed.”

Follow this guidance for subsequent notifications, updates, and all-clear messages.

This preserves trust and transparency while avoiding the impression that HMS IT is misleadingly taking ownership of external work.

### Status update

During an outage, status update emails give users information that can’t wait until the all-clear email is sent when the outage is resolved.

**Provide new or critical information.** Share updates such as partial service restoration or newly identified issues. The priority is to provide critical information to users — information that wasn’t included in the original outage notification email. An update email should *not* be sent only to reiterate that HMS IT continues to work toward a resolution. To justify an HMS-wide email, you need to include substantive information or requests that the user take an important action.

In the update:

- **Outline any required user actions.** Specify steps users need to take to access services or mitigate the impact.
- **Reiterate remaining issues and their impact.** Keep users informed about unresolved issues and their effects.
- **Continue offering alternatives if applicable.** Suggest additional workarounds or solutions as needed.

These messages can be short and impersonal.

### All-clear

All-clear emails let users know when an outage is resolved and provide an opportunity to rebuild the user’s confidence through empathy and explanation.

1. **Notify the user that the issue is resolved.** Specify which services are restored. Inform users that normal operations can resume.
1. **Acknowledge the impact on users, but don’t apologize.** Instead, thank users for their patience and understanding.
1. *Optional*: If relevant and without exposing security vulnerabilities, explain what caused the issue.
1. *Optional*: Describe any steps that will be taken to prevent the issue in the future.
1. **Provide links to resources and contact information** for ongoing support.
