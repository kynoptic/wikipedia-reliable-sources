# Organization of knowledge base articles on the HMS IT Service Portal

*Guidelines for information architecture (IA) that enhances user experience on the HMS IT knowledge base.*

## Introduction

This document aims to provide a structured approach to categorizing and organizing content within the HMS IT knowledge base. By establishing clear guidelines, we ensure that users can efficiently locate the information they need, enhancing the overall user experience.

The guidelines outlined in this document apply to all content creators and managers responsible for developing and maintaining articles in the HMS IT knowledge base. This encompasses both the end-user knowledge base and the staff knowledge base.

These guidelines are based on user research conducted to understand what categories users would expect to find HMS IT content in and on best practices for focused documentation.

## Organization of knowledge base content

To optimize the user experience on the HMS IT knowledge base, it's essential to categorize and structure the content effectively. Users often find articles via links on the website that they've found through web searches or via a search directly on the HMS IT Service Portal. By anticipating their needs and organizing content clearly, we ensure that users quickly find relevant information.

### Knowledge bases

There are two main knowledge bases for HMS IT: the **end-user knowledge base** for the HMS community and the **staff knowledge base** for HMS IT staff.

### Types of articles

Knowledge base articles should fit into one of four primary documentation types:

- **How-to guide** – Provides step-by-step solutions for specific problems.
- **Tutorial** – Introduces new users to services or software, focusing on teaching.
- **Reference** – Offers comprehensive lists of options, policies, and details.
- **Background information** – Explains service configurations for HMS IT staff.

If an article doesn't align with these types, we recommend providing the information elsewhere.
