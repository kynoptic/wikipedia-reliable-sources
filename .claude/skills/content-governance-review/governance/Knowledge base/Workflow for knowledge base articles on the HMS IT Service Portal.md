## Workflow

This section describes the process for creating, editing, and retiring articles.

### Creating articles

While all HMS IT staff can contribute to the knowledge base, contributors may only create articles if the information that they will provide is:

- Needed by the community
- Not already provided by HMS IT, HUIT, or other trusted sources
- Appropriate for the knowledge base

This essential first step in the article creation process ensures that users will use the information we provide and that the work to build and maintain the knowledge base is being done efficiently.

After the article is deemed necessary in the first step, proceed to the steps that follow:

- **Contributors** and **liaisons** *determine if an article is needed*, using the guidance in:

- **Contributors** *write* the article using:

### Editing articles

Any HMS IT staff member can edit an article, but only if their change is relatively minor. You should consult with your knowledge liaison or a knowledge manager if you think an article needs a significant change.

For minor changes:

1. The **contributor** *edits* the article and *submits* the edit for review.
1. The **knowledge manager** *reviews* the edit and *publishes* the updated version.

Significant changes follow the same process as the one used in creating new articles.

### Retiring articles

Only knowledge managers can retire articles. If you think an article must be retired, contact a knowledge manager and request that they retire the article.

1. The **contributor** *requests* that an article be retired.
1. The **knowledge manager** *reviews* the request and *retires* the article.
