# Content guidelines for news articles on the HMS IT website

## *Standards for creating helpful news articles for the HMS community*

## Introduction

This document establishes content guidelines for creating news articles on the HMS IT website. Its primary purpose is to ensure that IT updates, changes, and security alerts are communicated effectively and in alignment with the needs of the HMS community. By adhering to these guidelines, editors can deliver timely, accurate, and actionable information that minimizes work disruptions and reduces the volume of IT support tickets.

These guidelines apply to all news articles posted on the HMS IT website. They are intended for web editors responsible for developing news articles, ensuring that each article meets user needs and supports the business objectives of HMS IT.

HMS IT strives to keep the HMS community informed of important IT updates while minimizing unnecessary disruptions to users' work. News articles are a vital communication tool for non-critical updates, minor disruptions, and supplemental information, helping users stay informed without over-reliance on broadcast emails. These articles aim to reduce IT support tickets and user frustration by clearly communicating essential details. The content guidelines draw on best practices in content strategy and user experience, emphasizing clarity, actionability, and empathy toward user needs.

## Summary

Use informative, actionable, and plain language to provide timely updates to the HMS community, aiming to minimize disruptions and reduce support tickets. 

Use news articles for ****temporary and non-critical IT updates, or for details that supplement email messages to the community. Use email for significant disruptions, when user actions are required, and for privacy-related changes.

### Content guidelines

#### This section outlines the standards for creating news articles on the HMS IT website, ensuring content is clear, consistent, and aligned with user needs and business objectives.

#### Purpose and goals

- **Page objective** – Provide timely, accurate, and actionable information about IT updates, changes, and security alerts relevant to the HMS community.
- **User needs** – Access essential updates (software upgrades, system downtimes, security alerts) and understand the necessary steps to minimize work disruptions.
- **Business goals**:
    - Inform users of important updates that do not warrant a quad-wide email.
    - Provide supplemental or detailed information alongside email communications.
    - Serve as a hub for ongoing updates on major outages or projects.
    - Reduce IT support tickets by providing clear, proactive communication.

#### Audience

HMS faculty, staff, students, researchers, and guests using HMS IT services.

#### Tone

The tone must be **informative, precise, supportive, and empathetic**. News articles must:

- Avoid jargon and technical complexity. Use straightforward, accessible language with plain language alternatives for common technical terms.
- Be direct and actionable, clearly outlining the next steps for users.
- Maintain a calm, reassuring tone, anticipating potential user concerns or frustrations, especially when discussing risks or disruptions. Offer clear guidance on mitigating issues.
- Empathize with users by framing content around user impact and needs. Focus on what readers must know or do rather than only what the IT team wants to communicate.

#### When to use news articles

News articles are best suited for:

- **Information relevant for a limited time** – Use articles for updates that will remain valuable for a specific period but won't require long-term visibility.
- **Non-critical disruptions to work** – Use articles for updates on minor disruptions or changes that do not immediately threaten the user's work. Consider a broadcast email if HMS IT staff expects significant disruption.
- **Supplemental updates** – Post articles to provide additional details and to complement emails, allowing users to dive deeper into information about ongoing projects, system downtimes, or security updates.

#### When to use email instead

Use email in the following cases:

- **User's work will be significantly disrupted** – If a user's work may be at risk or they could lose access to critical tools, use a broadcast email to ensure they are notified well in advance.
- **User action is required** – If the user must complete a task (for example, update software or follow security protocols) to prevent work disruptions or loss of access, an email is the best way to request action.
- **User privacy changes** – Always email when updates affect user privacy or system changes lead to the visibility of previously undisclosed information, such as private user details visible to IT staff.
