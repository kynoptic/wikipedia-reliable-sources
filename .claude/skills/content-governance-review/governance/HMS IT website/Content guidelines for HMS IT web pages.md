# Content guidelines for HMS IT web pages—DRAFT

*Editorial and structural guidance for HMS IT website content*

## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to provide detailed content guidelines for the HMS IT website, ensuring **consistency in structure, tone, and functionality across all web pages**. These guidelines are designed to help content creators and managers craft user-focused pages that communicate information effectively while aligning with HMS IT’s broader goals of accessibility, clarity, and user satisfaction.

This document **applies to all web pages hosted on the HMS IT website that don’t have more specific guidance** (like for services or news articles). It is intended for use by content creators, editors, and managers responsible for creating, reviewing, or maintaining web content. The guidelines cover editorial practices, suggestions and standards within the content management system (CMS), and user experience considerations such as tone, voice, and action-oriented design elements.

Consistency in web content is critical for user trust and effective communication. Misalignment in content structure or tone can lead to confusion, increased support requests, and decreased user satisfaction. To address these challenges, **this document incorporates best practices from content strategy, usability studies, and input from HMS IT stakeholders**. By standardizing web content creation and maintenance processes, we aim to meet user needs and reduce the reliance on direct IT support.
