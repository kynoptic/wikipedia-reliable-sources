## Content guidelines

This section describes the content that will appear on the page, including the short description, introduction, and department accordion fields. The department accordions include a template with bracketed variables to clarify the structure, with an example of how Research Computing might align with that template.

# Departments

*Learn how our teams support the School’s technology, research, and administrative needs*

HMS IT is organized into specialized departments, each responsible for key aspects of the School’s technology infrastructure, research computing, and administrative systems. This page provides an overview of these departments, highlighting their core responsibilities, key partnerships, and team members.

### [Department Name]

*[One-sentence summary of the department’s purpose and impact.]* 

`[Primary service]`, `[Secondary service]` – Two very short, clear labels for the collapsed accordion that describe the department’s main functions.

Led by **[Leader's Name]**, [Leader’s Title], [Department Name] is responsible for **[concise mission statement and core responsibilities]**. The team helps [key audience or function] by [high-level summary of department’s work]. 

[Department Name] provides **[Service 1]**, which [briefly explains its function and who benefits]. It also offers **[Service 2]**, focusing on [summary of its role and audience].
