# Organization of communications governance documents at HMS IT

*Information architecture (IA) for communications governance across staff KB, OneDrive, and SharePoint*

## Introduction

These guidelines provide a **framework for organizing, storing, and managing *internal*** **communications governance documentation** to ensure easy access, consistency, and support for HMS IT staff responsible for creating, reviewing, and maintaining such documentation.

**These guidelines govern all HMS IT communications governance content**, including *governance* for broadcast emails, knowledge base articles, website content, internal communications, and content produced by communication governance activities and working group members.

This organizational method adheres to **best practices in content strategy** and is **informed by our external communications platforms** (email, website, knowledge base) and the **tools and processes used** by communications groups at HMS IT (Teams, OneDrive, SharePoint, staff KB).

## Summary

Documentation related to communication activities is stored in three different places:

- HMS IT Service Portal knowledge base – Articles restricted to HMS IT staff in the [knowledge base](https://harvardmed.service-now.com/stat?id=stat_knowledge) contain tool-specific guidance and tutorials accessible to all staff members.
- **Communication working group folders in OneDrive** – The XF folders used by working groups house drafts, meeting notes, and archives accessible only to group members.
- SharePoint intranet – The [communications page on the intranet site](https://hu.sharepoint.com/sites/HMSITAllStaff-Internal/SitePages/IT-Communications.aspx) and the associated [Communications governance folder](https://hu.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/HMSITAllStaff-Internal/IT%20Internal%20documents/Communications%20governance?csf=1&web=1&e=IdKSiV) houses official guidelines, governance documents, and style guides accessible to all HMS IT staff.Within the SharePoint intranet folder, governance is organized within these folders:
    - **General** – This folder is for high-level governance and is applicable to all our communications.
    - **Broadcast email** – This folder is for communications governance for emails to the HMS community.
    - **HMS IT website** – This folder houses communications governance for the HMS IT website.
    - **Knowledge base** – This folder houses guidance for KB articles.
    - **Internal communications** – This folder is for guidelines like this one.
- ****Within each of these folders in the SharePoint intranet folder, there will typically be three types of documents:

- 

- **Organization and context** – Covers what is often called *information architecture* or *content models* in a content strategy framework, these documents (like this one) outline how pieces of content are organized within a larger framework of the platform and how that platform fits into other platforms used as part of the user experience.
- **Editorial guidelines** – This includes overarching governance like the *style guide*, detailed *content guidelines* for common types of pages, and simplified *starter templates* for editors to customize. These documents dictate how the content itself must be structured.
- **Workflow and responsibilities** – Documents here cover who does what and when to create and edit the content. These documents are about people and processes.

> There will typically be one document per platform for each of these three areas, with additional sub documents created when the main document become too unwieldy or when individual documents make more sense.

## Repositories

### Context

The repositories used for storing governance documentation are contextually sensitive, leveraging the platforms HMS IT staff regularly use: Service Portal, OneDrive, and SharePoint.

These repositories store documents that support communication operations, which typically occur through Teams chats among Communications working groups and via email.

#### Content within the SharePoint intranet

The SharePoint intranet folder contains organized governance guidelines and materials across various categories. This section explains the purpose of each folder and the types of documents you will find within them.

##### Governance folders

Each governance folder in the SharePoint intranet serves a distinct purpose:

###### General

The **General** folder contains high-level governance applicable to all HMS communications. For example, a style guide outlining editorial standards for all digitals. This ensures that all communications align with the overarching policies and standards of HMS IT.

###### Broadcast email

To ensure all broadcast emails are consistent in tone, format, and content, the **Broadcast email** folder focuses on governance for emails sent to the HMS community. For example, template for communications about outages. This ensures that 

###### HMS IT website

To ensure that the website content is accurate, up-to-date, and user-friendly, the **HMS IT website** folder includes governance for content published on the HMS IT website. For example, a content guide for service pages.

###### Knowledge base

To ensure that all knowledge base articles are informative, well-organized, and easy to understand, the **Knowledge base** folder provides guidance for creating and managing KB articles. For example, style guidelines specific to KB articles or publishing and editing workflows for KB articles.

###### Internal communications / Communications governance documents

The **Communications governance documents** folder includes guidelines for creating and maintaining communication governance itself. For example, a guideline document detailing the steps for creating a governance policy for a new communication channel. This folder helps ensure all communications governance follow a consistent framework.

##### Document types within each folder

Within each folder, you will typically find three types of documents:

###### Organization and context

The **Organization and context** document or folder outlines the structure of content within the larger framework of the platform. Known as *information architecture (IA)* in a content strategy framework, it details how content pieces are organized and how this platform integrates with other platforms used in the user experience. For example. an information architecture document for the HMS IT website, mapping out the site’s main sections, navigation paths, and content hierarchy.

###### Editorial guidelines and templates

The **Guidelines and templates** documents, referred to as "content models" in a content strategy framework, provide instructions on how to structure information on individual pages. They ensure consistency and clarity across all communications. For example, a template for creating a new KB article, including sections for the title, introduction, step-by-step instructions, and troubleshooting tips.

###### Workflow and responsibilities

The **Workflow and responsibilities** documents cover the processes and people involved in content creation and editing. These documents specify who is responsible for various tasks and the timeline for completing them, ensuring that all content management processes are clear and efficient. For example, a workflow for the distribution of a new broadcast email, detailing each step from drafting to approval and distribution.
