## Introduction

The introduction provides the “why” behind the document. In clear, paragraph prose, cover the following three sections:

- **Purpose of the document** – Define the intent of this specific governance document. State what it aims to achieve and who the primary audience is (for example, “This style guide is for content creators and managers…”, “This template is for anyone creating a service page…”).
- **Scope and applicability** – Clearly specify the boundaries of this governance. State which platforms, content types, teams, and scenarios it applies to (for example, “This document applies to all broadcast email communications sent by HMS IT…”, “These guidelines govern all news articles published on the HMS IT website…”).
- **Background and justification** – Explain why this governance is necessary. Base the guidance on user needs, organizational goals, and practical implementation considerations. Reference the origins of the guidance, such as best practices in content strategy, user research, or input from relevant working groups.

**Bold** key phrases to make the introduction’s core points scannable.

## Summary

Provide a high-level overview of the document’s key takeaways to help readers quickly grasp the essential rules.

- Highlight the most critical rules or structural elements.
- If applicable, include a visual aid like a screenshot of a well-structured example.

## Content guidelines

This is the core of the document. It must be structured to move from high-level strategy to specific, tactical instructions.

### 1. Content brief

This section establishes the strategic foundation for the content type.

- **Objective** – What is the primary goal of this content type? (for example, “To provide timely, accurate, and actionable information about IT updates…”)
- **User needs** – What problem does this content solve for the user? (for example, “Users must understand the necessary steps to minimize work disruptions.”)
- **Business goals** – How does this content support HMS IT’s objectives? (for example, “To reduce IT support tickets by providing clear, proactive communication.”)
- **Audience:**
    - **Primary** – Who is the main audience?
    - **Secondary** – Who else might use this content?
- **Tone** – Describe the specific tone required for this type of content (for example, “The tone must be informative, precise, supportive, and empathetic.”).

### 2. Content structure and components

Break the content type down into its core components in the order they appear. For each element, provide the following details:

#### **Component name** (for example, Subject line, Intro title, Accordion Item)

- **CMS field and HTML tag** – Specify the technical implementation (for example, `Main content > Title`, `<h1>`).
- **Purpose** – Explain the goal of this component (for example, “To clearly communicate the page’s topic, aligning with user search intent.”).
- **Guidance** – Provide specific, prescriptive rules for writing and formatting this component. Use bullet points or numbered lists if needed for clarity.
- **Examples** – Provide clear good and bad examples to illustrate the rules. For example:
    - ✅ *Install CrowdStrike to protect against security risks*
    - ⛔ *Information on the new CrowdStrike security software*
