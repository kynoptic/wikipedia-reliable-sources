## Summary

**Teams** offer a collaboration environment with up to 25TB of storage via SharePoint, 1,000 combined standard and shared channels, and 30 private channels. Teams can have up to 25,000 members. When archived, all activity is paused, but past interactions and data remain accessible.

**Channels** are sub-sections within teams for focused communication. There are three types of channels: standard (no user limit, accessible to all team members), private (up to 250 members), and shared (up to 5,000 members within Harvard). Shared channels streamline collaboration by reducing the need for separate teams.

Channels simplify management, align with specific workstreams, and make it easier for leadership to oversee projects. Retention policies for channel content should comply with Harvard's General Records Schedule (GRS).

## Teams

Teams are comprehensive collaboration environments with **multiple channels for different projects or topics**.

Each team has **25TB of storage space** available through SharePoint to meet all needs related to team and channel documents, including files and recorded meetings. A team can have **up to 1,000 combined standard and shared channels and 30 private channels** for focused collaboration among select members. A team can have up to 25,000 members.

**Archiving** a team pauses all activity within that team, including its private channels and linked SharePoint site. However, all past interactions, such as messages in both public and private channels, are saved and remain accessible. This archival function halts team operations while preserving historical data for future reference.

## Channels

Channels are sub-sections within a team designed for more focused group communication. You can [customize channel notifications](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/customize-channel-notifications-in-microsoft-teams-c72b8c07-37e1-4a0b-82c9-fdfda04f15b2) to focus your work further.

While standard channels **don't have a specific user limit**, they are subject to the overall team member cap of 25,000. 

For archiving, Microsoft documents methods to [archive or restore a channel](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/archive-or-restore-a-channel-53c46491-a265-4391-a2a7-001c5026c9e5), but this functionality is not available as of March 2024. You can, however, download the files stored within the channel's corresponding SharePoint folder.

### Types of channels

Teams channels come in three types:

1. **Standard** – Accessible to all team members without a user limit.
1. **Private** – For a select group of up to 250 team members.
1. Shared – Allows up to 5,000 members, including those not added at the team level but within Harvard. Currently, adding members from outside Harvard is not supported. Shared channels facilitate efficient collaboration by mitigating the need for multiple teams for different projects. Shared channels are a practical workaround for certain limitations of private channels. It's vital for team owners to judiciously manage member additions to preserve the channel's purpose. Microsoft has documentation on how to [create a shared channel](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-shared-channel-in-microsoft-teams-80712457-579e-42b2-b54f-112329578aaa).

### Benefits of channels

Channels in Microsoft Teams offer several advantages for group communication. These benefits include:

- **Simplified management** – Channels operate within the framework of an existing team, eliminating the need to create and manage a separate team. This simplicity leads to less overhead.
- **Work alignment** – They enable a tighter alignment with specific workstreams, projects, or discussions, providing a focused space for collaboration.
- **Ease of oversight for leadership** – For leaders, channels within a team simplify the oversight of multiple projects by consolidating them, reducing the necessity to sift through many separate teams.
- **Information separation**: Channels facilitate the organization of information and discussions pertinent to different sub-teams or topics, enhancing the organization within the team's broader activities.

## Retention policy

Users must consult the Harvard [General Records Schedule (GRS)](https://library.harvard.edu/services-tools/general-records-schedule) for specific guidance on retention periods and archiving processes to ensure compliance with institutional policies. Retention policies may differ depending on the type of information stored.
