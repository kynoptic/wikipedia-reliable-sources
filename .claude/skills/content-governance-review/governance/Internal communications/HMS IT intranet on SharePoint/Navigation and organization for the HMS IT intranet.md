# Navigation and organization for the HMS IT intranet

*Information architecture for the HMS intranet for staff hosted on SharePoint, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience for key organizational areas.*

## Introduction

This document defines and standardizes the information architecture for the HMS IT intranet on SharePoint. It provides guidance on organizing, labeling, and categorizing content to ensure employees can easily find and interact with essential information. The primary audience includes content managers, intranet administrators, and anyone responsible for maintaining the SharePoint site.

This document applies to all content on the HMS IT intranet, covering domains such as IT governance, finance, human resources, project management, and operations. All teams and individuals responsible for content creation and management must follow these guidelines to ensure consistency in information structure and access.

The HMS IT intranet is a central hub for employees to access vital information, tools, and resources. Over time, inconsistent labeling, content placement, and lack of standardized structure can make navigation challenging. To address this, a working group reviewed existing content and conducted a card sort exercise with HMS IT staff to understand their organizational preferences. The resulting information architecture guide aligns with staff expectations and aims to enhance user experience and internal communication.
