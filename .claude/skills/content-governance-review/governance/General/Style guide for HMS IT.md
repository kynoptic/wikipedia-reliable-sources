## Summary

Use a professional voice:

- Use a professional and empathetic voice.
- Avoid humor; use a formal, direct, and friendly approach.
- Communicate problems as opportunities, emphasizing positive aspects.

Be clear and concise:

- Use simple, understandable words and avoid jargon.
- Write direct, concise sentences. Avoid roundabout expressions and redundancies.
- Use active voice, present tense, and imperative mood.

Use consistent and intentional structure and formatting:

- Write short, well-structured paragraphs, breaking content into sections with descriptive headers.
- Format dates and times descriptively and consistently.
- Format complex lists or over three items long as bulleted or numbered lists, maintaining parallel phrasing and proper punctuation.
- Ensure consistent capitalization, following sentence case for most text, title case for proper nouns and published works, and all caps and lowercase only in specific cases.
- Use monospace, bold, and italics purposefully for code, user inputs, UI elements, and emphasis.
- Use tables for tabular data, not for layout.

## Use a professional voice

Use a professional voice in all communications. The HMS IT community often searches IT content for information on using or fixing software and services. Users may be frustrated and confused, seeking quick solutions. Write with sensitivity to this context.

**Create helpful messages.** Provide clarity and understanding with professional and empathetic writing. Be formal, direct, and friendly. Write as a knowledgeable mentor, offering expert guidance with humanity and care.

**Be approachable and positive.** Communicate problems as opportunities and emphasize any positive aspects. Avoid humor, which may be insensitive to frustrated users and undermine professionalism and clarity.

**Provide clear instructions.** Give directives to help users achieve their goals.

**Avoid using** ***please*** **and** ***thank you***, as they can imply optional steps and cause confusion.

The voice of HMS IT communications must be:

- **Formal, but not stuffy**
- **Approachable, but not entertaining**
- **Polite, but not mannered**

## Write clearly and concisely

This section provides best practices for writing clear and precise content. It covers word choice, sentence structure, positive language, and content organization. Use these guidelines to ensure your writing is accessible, engaging, and easy to follow.

### Use simple and understandable words

Use only words and phrases our readers understand to ensure accessibility and engagement. Reflect the language used by our audience and prefer familiar, shorter, or more straightforward terms. Refer to [the HMS IT word list](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tfzz1i9mur455lq/HMS%20IT%20word%20list%E2%80%94DRAFT.docx?dl=0) for specific recommendations. Use contractions — they're shorter and more friendly than the expanded form.

Balance simplicity and familiarity with precision to prevent misunderstandings. If a word has multiple meanings, choose something more specific to avoid confusion. Define uncommon terms when introducing acronyms, abbreviations, or necessary but obscure terminology, explaining their meaning when the word first appears. Subsequent usage doesn't require a definition.

Avoid jargon, clichés, slang, idioms, and double-speak to promote inclusivity and clarity. Avoid discriminatory language. Don’t ask rhetorical questions; instead, make statements. For example, change *Wondering how to access your email? Read these instructions to get started:* to *These instructions explain how to access your email:*.

Avoid abstract or subjective terms that can often be revised out of sentences. For example, *Configure the backup feature after installation* can be *Configure backups after installation*. Commonly unnecessary words include *feature*, *process*, *function*, *factor*, *area*, *condition*, *aspect*, and *degree*. Removing empty words makes the text more straightforward and concise.

### Write direct and concise sentences

Write sentences that cover a single topic with fewer than 26 words to enhance readability. Break long, complex sentences into shorter ones. Avoid unnecessary wordiness to clarify concepts.

Avoid roundabout expressions. Condense common short phrases without losing their meaning. For example, *on a weekly basis* can be *weekly*, and *in the near future* can be *soon* or *shortly*. This makes the text more direct and efficient.

Avoid redundancies by not repeating words found in the preceding acronym and cutting needless words from common short phrases. For example, *macOS operating system* should be *macOS* and *join together* should be *join*. This keeps the text concise and focused.

Avoid unnecessary modifiers. Weak or overused modifiers rarely improve meaning, clarity, or impact. Words like *absolutely*, *actually*, *basically*, *completely*, *easily*, *particularly*, *simply*, *totally*, and *very* can usually be removed without changing the sentence's importance. This strengthens the sentence.

Avoid nominalizations and weak verbs. Nominalization turns a strong verb into a phrase with a noun and a weak verb. For example, revise *When a search is performed, the system undergoes an evaluation of the records* to *When you search, the system evaluates the records*. Using strong verbs makes writing more dynamic and easier to understand.

### Write positively

Avoid double negatives. Rewrite negative expressions to be positive where practical. For example, *not without* can be *has*, and *isn't impossible* can be *is possible*. Positive statements are clearer and more direct.

### Use active voice

Use the active voice to clarify who or what acts. The passive voice is sometimes clearer and more natural, but it is often needlessly wordy and indirect. For example, *The software installation must be carried out by an administrator* should be *An administrator must install the software*. Active voice makes sentences clearer and more engaging.

### Use present tense and imperative mood

Use the present tense when giving instructions, as the user follows along in real-time. Write in the second-person imperative mood to address the reader directly and tell them what to do. The second-person imperative mood uses *you* and command verbs to create direct and clear instructions. For example, instead of saying *The software should be installed by you*, say *Install the software*. This creates a sense of immediacy and directness, making instructions easier to follow.

### Use the Oxford comma

Use the Oxford comma, also called the serial comma, before the last item in a list to help reduce ambiguity. The Oxford comma clarifies the separation of items in a list, preventing potential misinterpretation.

### Write short and well-structured paragraphs

Use the paragraph form by default to structure content within sections. Paragraphs help the reader navigate the document and strengthen the impact of other formats like lists, tables, and screenshots. Use the paragraph form as the foundation of your message.

Address only one topic per paragraph to organize information effectively. Write paragraphs that are six sentences or shorter; three to four sentences per paragraph are ideal. Start each paragraph with a topic sentence to make navigating the text easier for the reader. Use a linking sentence to transition from the previous paragraph if a transition clarifies the connection between the two paragraphs.

### Break content into sections

Organize your document so users can quickly orient themselves and find the necessary information. Users rarely read a page from start to finish; they skim to find relevant information. Even if they must read the entire document to accomplish a task, they will review it to ensure they are in the right place.

Help users understand the content by breaking it into logical sections with descriptive headers. Vary the content using paragraphs, notices, and lists to make the document easier to skim.

Keep introductory material short. Users will likely skip introductions, so get right to the point with only a sentence or two to elaborate on the title and short description or explain what the document will help the user do.

## Format text consistently

Format the copy using these guidelines to help orient users and improve clarity.

### Use short, descriptive, action-oriented titles and headings

Clear titles and headings help users find what they are looking for and increase their confidence in the message's relevance. Use short and descriptive headings. Users typically try to accomplish a task, so use action words in titles and headings. Avoid the FAQ format. For example:

- ⛔ *Information on how to acquire Microsoft software for Apple mobile devices*
- ⛔ *How do I get Microsoft apps for my iPhone?*
- ✅ *Install Microsoft Outlook on iOS*

**Use sentence case in titles and headings.** Sentence case is easier to read and makes it easier to identify capitalized programs and services that users frequently seek.

Avoid vague headings like *Introduction*, *More information*, or *Step two*. Be as specific as possible in labeling. The heading titles will depend on the purpose of the message. For example:

- *Prerequisites* → *Required software*
- *Introduction* → *What this software does*
- *Next steps* → *Configure the software after installing*

Write headings with parallel phrasing. Headings that follow a consistent pattern are more comfortable to follow. Try to make them around the same length and have them follow the same kind of phrasing.

⛔ Don’t use inconsistent phrasing like this:

- *Licensing*
- *Install the software on your mobile devices*
- *How to configure the software to improve privacy*

✅ Instead, use parallel phrasing, like this:

- *Acquire a license*
- *Install on mobile devices*
- *Configure for privacy*

Also, avoid stacked headings by introducing a new section with prose before jumping to a subsection. Prefer fewer levels of headings to keep the document clear and navigable. Avoid numbering headings.

### Format dates and times consistently

Use the following guidelines to ensure consistency and clarity when writing dates and times.

#### Spell out dates and times

Spell out dates and times on the first usage in a document, using the format "Wednesday, January 1, 2020, at 3:30 PM EDT (UTC-4)."

Include the minutes even if a time lands directly on the hour, as in *7:00 AM*. Only use *7 AM* when space is limited. Write out *noon* and *midnight*. Avoid *12:00 PM* and *12:00 AM*.

Use the shorter format on repeat usage of a date. Only use the shortest formats when necessary, such as in subject lines or alert banners. Otherwise, use the first or second listed formats.

#### Specify the time zone

Use the proper time zone for the location. You can check this on [the page for Boston on timeanddate.com](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zone/usa/boston).

- **EST (UTC-5)** – Use from the first Sunday of November to the second Sunday of March.
- **EDT (UTC-4)** – Use from the second Sunday of March to the first Sunday of November.

For periods crossing daylight saving time changes, include the time zone after both times.

#### Use HR names for holiday breaks

For holiday breaks, use the language provided in the Harvard Human Resources calendar. Refer to [the official holiday calendar provided by the Harvard Human Resources office](https://hr.harvard.edu/holiday-calendar).

#### Examples of date and time formats

##### Date

- Wednesday, January 1, 2020
- January 1
- Jan 1

##### Time

- Wednesday, January 1, 2020, at 5:00 PM EST (UTC-5)
- January 1 at 5:00 PM
- Jan 1 at 5 PM

##### Time at noon

- Wednesday, January 1, 2020, at noon EST (UTC-5)
- January 1 at noon
- Jan 1 at noon

##### Time at midnight

Whenever possible, avoid midnight as a planned start or end time. Prefer *12:01 AM* or *11:59 PM*. *12:15 AM* and *11:45 PM* are even better.

- the midnight EST (UTC-5) starting Wednesday, January 1, 2020
- the midnight starting January 1
- the midnight starting Jan 1

##### Span of dates

- from Wednesday, January 1, 2020, to Friday, January 3
- from January 1 to January 3
- from Jan 1 to Jan 3
- January 1–3
- Jan 1–3

##### Span of times within the same day

- Wednesday, January 1, 2020, from 3:00 AM to 12:30 PM EST (UTC-5)
- January 1, from 3:00 AM to 12:30 PM
- Jan 1, 3 AM–12:30 PM

##### Span of times within the same morning or afternoon

- Wednesday, January 1, 2020, from 3:00 AM to 10:30 AM EST (UTC-5)
- January 1, from 3:00 AM to 10:30 AM EST

- from January 1 at 3:00 PM to January 3 at 12:30 AM
- Jan 1 at 3 PM to Jan 3 at 12:30 AM

### Use lists effectively

Draw attention and make messages easier to skim by using lists. However, avoid overusing lists. They are most effective when integrated into the document appropriately. Avoid writing entirely in list form. Avoid the FAQ format.

- **Use lists for multiple items or steps** – Describe two or three simple items within a sentence rather than breaking them into a list.
- **Limit the number of list items** – Split lists of ten or more items into separate sections.
- **Introduce lists with context** – Use introductory text to contextualize the list and orient the reader.
- **Choose the correct list type** – Use bullets for lists where the order of items does not matter, like a list of features, options, or items. Use numbered lists when the order is important, like step-by-step instructions, ranking, or sequences of events.
- **Refer to steps by their content, not number** – Numbers may change as instructions are updated. Refer to a step’s process or goal instead of *See step 4* or *Repeat steps 7–9*.
- **Maintain parallel phrasing and formatting** – Ensure items in a list are similar in length and form.
- **Use periods appropriately** – End list items with a period if any item is a complete sentence. Exclude periods in simple lists of individual items.
- **Describe one user action per step** – Do not combine several activities in a single list item in a step-by-step list.
- **Keep multi-part list items concise** – Instead of nesting list items, prefer a single line with parts formatted as in this list: bold primary item, en-dash, then additional information.

### Use consistent capitalization

This section provides instructions on when to use sentence case, title case, all caps, and lowercase in various contexts. Proper capitalization enhances readability and ensures consistency across documents.

#### Sentence case

In sentence case, capitalize the first word of the sentence and proper nouns. Use sentence case as the default for most text. This approach improves readability and helps identify capitalized programs and services. Apply sentence case to titles, headings, navigation text, and acronyms that are not proper nouns.

#### Title case

In title case, capitalize the first letter of each word. Use title case for proper nouns, such as names of companies and applications. This also applies to product components, team names, job titles, and published works like blogs and books. Use title case for the names of keyboard keys.

#### All caps

Use all caps sparingly, primarily for port names, first-level registry subtrees, acronyms, and user input variables. Do not use all caps for emphasis. Follow the official styling for branded acronyms and file types. In HTML, wrap acronyms and abbreviations in the `<abbr>` tag.

#### Lowercase

Certain text should always be lowercase, even at the start of a sentence. This includes file extensions and URLs.

#### Examples

The table below outlines specific capitalization rules and examples:

|**Element**|**Casing**|**Example**|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Titles|Sentence case|Find the serial number of your computer.<br>New cybersecurity protections at HMS|

By following these capitalization rules, you ensure clarity and consistency across all written communications.

### Format text to make it easier to understand

This section outlines the formatting standards for internal and external communications. It includes font usage, HTML tags for specific text styles, guidelines for using quotes, and proper use of notices and tables. Follow these guidelines to ensure your content is consistent, accessible, and easy to read.

#### Use Microsoft defaults for internal communications

Use Microsoft defaults for internal communications using Word and Outlook: Aptos, Aptos Display or Aptos Serif, and `Aptos Mono`.

#### Follow identity guidelines for external communications

Follow the HMS identity guidelines for external communications. Use Libre Franklin for headers and Roboto Slab for paragraph text. Pair Roboto Mono with Roboto Slab for monospace text. Use these fonts when possible.

If the publishing platform does not support these fonts, use the widely supported defaults listed below or the fonts bundled with Microsoft and Adobe software:

|**Label**|**Display (serif)**|**Header (sans-serif)**|**Monospace**|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Harvard Style Guide|Roboto Slab|Libre Franklin|Roboto Mono|
|Modern default|Times New Roman|Arial|Courier New|
|Classic default|Times|Helvetica|Courier|
|Microsoft|Aptos Serif|Aptos|Aptos Mono|
|Adobe|Source Serif Pro|Source Sans Pro|Source Code Pro|

#### Use monospace, bold, and italics

Follow these guidelines for semantic HTML tags and conventions used by major browsers.

##### Monospace

Semantic HTML tags like `<code>` and `<kbd>` , typically styled in monospace formatting, improve **accessibility** by clearly signaling to assistive technologies what type of content is being presented. This ensures users relying on tools like screen readers understand whether text is actionable input, system output, or programming code.

Monospace formatting also enhances **usability** by visually distinguishing technical elements from narrative or instructional text. Consistent monospace usage helps users quickly identify critical information and accurately recognize individual characters, essential when entering precise commands, URLs, or troubleshooting errors.

Together, these practices improve clarity, precision, and accessibility in technical communications.

Use **monospace** formatting for:

- Code from any programming language
- User inputs and keypresses
- Computer outputs and error messages
- Directories, file names, and IP addresses
- Text where individual characters must be legible

> In general, use the <code> HTML tag for monospace text. Use the <samp> HTML tag specifically for outputs from the command-line interface and in error messages. For multi-line monospace text or text that should not be broken across lines, use the <pre> HTML tag. Wrap user inputs and key combinations in the <kbd> tag. Refer to guidelines from [Apple](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/what-are-those-symbols-shown-in-menus-cpmh0011/11.0/mac/11.0) and [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/customize/enterprise/keyboardfilter-key-names) for key names, which advise using Space bar instead of Space, for example.

##### Bold, italics, and quotes

- Use **bold** to highlight UI elements and important phrases or sentences. In HTML, wrap the text in `<strong>` for essential phrases and sentences, and use `<b>` for UI elements.
- Use **italics** for:
    - Emphasis
    - Offsetting variables
    - Citing full-length works
    - Referring to specific letters or words
- In HTML, use `<em>` for emphasis, `<var>` for variables, `<cite>` for citing works, `<dfn>` for defining words, and `<i>` for other types of offset text.
- Use straight quotes (") instead of curly quotes (“,”) for quotations and when citing shorter works. Turn off automatic smart quotes settings in [Word](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/smart-quotes-in-word-702fc92e-b723-4e3d-b2cc-71dedaf2f343) and on [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/replace-text-punctuation-documents-mac-mh35735/mac). Do not use quotes for figures of speech. For quotes within quotes, use single quotes. Always place punctuation outside of quotes, even if the quoted material ends with punctuation. For example: The programmer entered the crowded room and said "Hello, world!".
- Do not use **underline** or **strikethrough** unless referring to text styled this way.

|**Element**|**Appearance**|**Semantic HTML tag**|**Example**|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Inline code|Monospace|`<code>`|Use `<p>` at the start of a paragraph.|
|Pathnames, files, and folders|Monospace|`<code>`|Go to `/Users/USER_NAME/Downloads` to access the `Downloads` folder, then open `CA Certificate.mobileconfig`.|
|Data elements, key–value pairs|Monospace|`<code>`|For Name, the person's full name will appear, as in `Name = John Doe`.|
|Code block|Monospace|`<pre>`|Style your paragraphs in CSS with this code:<br>p {<br>color: red;<br>}|
|IP address|Monospace|`<code>`|`192.168.0.1`|
|Command-line output|Monospace|`<samp>`|`PC Load Letter`|
|Error message|Monospace|`<samp>`|`404 Not Found`<br>`Your computer encountered a problem and needs to restart.`|
|User input|Monospace|`<kbd>`|Next, type <kbd>mkdir</kbd>.<br>Press <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Delete</kbd> to restart.|
|Tabs|Bold|`<b>`|Select the **Connection** tab.|
|Menu names and items|Bold|`<b>`|Select **Start** > **Power** > **Shut down**.|
|Labels|Bold|`<b>`|On the **Settings** page, go to **Privacy and Security**.|
|Important text|Bold|`<strong>`|When writing a sentence, **bold the most important phrase** to draw attention to it.<br>You can also draw attention to longer strings of text. **Bold an entire sentence within a paragraph to indicate its importance.** In this case, bold the punctuation at the end of the sentence.|
|URL|Bold|`<b>`, `<kbd>` if manually entered|Use descriptive link text to direct users. For example: Visit [the HMS IT website](https://it.hms.harvard.edu/).If the URL itself must be displayed, bold it and hide the scheme (https://) and the subdomain when it is www. So [harvard.edu](https://www.harvard.edu/), not [https://www.harvard.edu](https://www.harvard.edu).Use the <kbd> tag when instructing users to type out a URL. For example: In Terminal, enter https://www.harvard.edu.|
|Email address|Bold|`<b>`, <`kbd>` if manually entered|Contact the HMS IT Service Desk at **itservicedesk@hms.harvard.edu**.<br>In Terminal, enter <kbd>itservicedesk@hms.harvard.edu</kbd>.|
|Variables in computer output|Monospace and italic|`<var>` inside of `<samp>`|The console will read `You are now connected to serverName`.|
|Variables in user input|Monospace, bold, and italic|`<var>` inside of `<kbd>`|In Terminal, enter <kbd>send to YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS</kbd>.|
|Blogs, books, and other published resources|Italics|`<i>`, `<cite>` for citations|*Engadget*<br>*Introduction to Algorithms*<br>According to the *New York Times*, the Supreme Court limited the reach of computer crimes in a recent 6–3 decision.|

|Shorter works|Quotes|`None`|"Inside IKEA's Digital Transformation" in the Harvard Business Review<br>"Computer Love" by Kraftwerk<br>"The Raven" by Edgar Allen Poe|
|Inline quote|Quotes|`<q>`|The poem opens with "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary."|
|Blockquotes|Offset text|`<blockquote>`|The poem ends with:<br>And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;<br>And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor<br>Shall be lifted—nevermore!|
|Figures of speech|None|None|The app will forget your settings if you don't save them.<br>The two servers will talk to each other to verify the data.|

### Use notices to draw attention

Use notices when bold text inline does not draw sufficient attention. This format can highlight hazards or important supplemental information.

Indent these notices and follow these guidelines:

- **Note** – Use this notice for information that may improve a process or clarify when there is a high likelihood of confusion.
- **⚠️ Caution** – Use this notice when users might lose data, face a security risk, or cause problems that are difficult to correct.

Place notices before the text they apply to and keep them concise.

### Use tables for tabular data only

**Avoid using tables solely for layout changes.** Tables used for design purposes can make the document inaccessible. Use tables to display tabular data or when no other logical format fits.

Follow these guidelines to ensure tables are accessible and user-friendly:

- **Use accessible HTML tables** – Tables must be presented in HTML format, not as links to external files such as shared Excel documents.
- **Introduce tables with explanatory text** – Provide context before the table so users understand its purpose.
- **Include a descriptive heading row** – Label each column clearly to help users navigate the data.
- **Add any measurements in the heading, not in each cell** – This avoids redundancy and improves clarity.
- **Align content appropriately** – Left-align text and right-align numerical data for readability.

Example of a well-formatted table:

|**Internet service provider**|**Service type**|**Connection speed (Mbps)**|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Verizon|Fiber optic|950|
|Xfinity|Cable|987|
|Viasat|Satellite|100|


Accessible HTML for this table would look like this:

```html
<table>
  <caption>Internet service provider comparison</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col" style="text-align: left;">Internet service provider</th>
      <th scope="col" style="text-align: left;">Service type</th>
      <th scope="col" style="text-align: right;">Connection speed (Mbps)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Verizon</th>
      <td>Fiber optic</td>
      <td>950</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Xfinity</th>
      <td>Cable</td>
      <td>987</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Viasat</th>
      <td>Satellite</td>
      <td>100</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```


**Prefer lists over tables when possible.** If a table is not necessary, use a list to present structured information. Formatting techniques such as commas, en dashes, bold, and italics can improve readability. For example, the table above could be formatted as:

- **Verizon** – Fiber optic, 950 Mbps
- **Xfinity** – Cable, 987 Mbps
- **Viasat** – Satellite, 100 Mbps

> This style guide is comprehensive, frequently updated, and easy to navigate. It is the most appropriate fallback for the “Style Guide for HMS IT” because it focuses on style for technical documentation and is not specific to any operating system.

Rackspace. "Rackspace Style Guide for Technical Content" 2020. [https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/style-guide/](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/style-guide/).

> The Rackspace style guide is second to the Google style guide because Rackspace is a smaller company with potentially weaker influence on industry standards. It is an excellent style guide and provides recommendations on screenshots not included in the Google style guide. If Google and Rackspace make the same style recommendation, do not override it with other advice in the HMS IT Style Guide.

Microsoft. "Microsoft Writing Style Guide," 2019. [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/).

> Use this style guide for questions on style specific to Microsoft products. It provides general guidance on brand communications and chatbots, making it less suitable as a primary reference for general documentation style.

Apple. "Apple Style Guide," 2019. [https://help.apple.com/applestyleguide/](https://help.apple.com/applestyleguide/).

> Use this guide for Apple products. Its scope is narrow, focusing on a word list rather than general style and tone guidelines.
