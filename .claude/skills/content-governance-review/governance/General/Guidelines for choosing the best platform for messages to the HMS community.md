# Guidelines for choosing the best platform for messages to the HMS community

*These guidelines will help you select the appropriate channel for communications to the HMS community*

## Introduction

This document aims to provide clear guidelines for selecting the most suitable communication channels for different types of messages to the HMS community. By following these guidelines, content creators and managers can ensure that their messages reach the intended audience effectively and efficiently.

These guidelines apply to all communications directed at the HMS community, including students, faculty, and staff. They cover broadcast email, the HMS IT website, and the knowledge base as primary communication channels.

Effective communication is crucial for the smooth operation and collaboration within the HMS community. Different messages require different levels of urgency and visibility, and choosing the appropriate channel is essential for maximizing the impact and efficiency of the communication. These guidelines are based on best practices in content strategy and organizational communication, aiming to enhance user experience and engagement by aligning the message type with the most effective communication platform.

## Summary

- **Broadcast email** – Ideal for time-sensitive information, user disruptions, action requests, or privacy updates. Avoid for evergreen content or non-urgent matters.

- 

- **HMS IT website** – Aims to help users with service desk support and service information. Includes general service details, news, events, and internal organization info.

- 

- **Knowledge base** – Contains detailed articles for how-to guides, tutorials, references, and background information.

## Guidelines for choosing communication channels

Use these recommendations to help you choose the best communications channel for your message.

### Broadcast email

Broadcast email is best when:

- **User's work will be significantly disrupted** – If the user is at risk of losing work or access to a tool they need for work, leverage the visibility of a broadcast email to let them know ahead of time.
- **User action is required** – If the user must do something to avoid losing work or access to a tool they need for work, an email is the best way to ask them to complete an action.
- **User privacy changes** – Send an email when updates affect user privacy or system changes make previously undisclosed information, containing private user details, visible to IT staff.
- **Information is relevant for a limited time** – Opt for email if the content is actionable for users now but loses value in the coming weeks.

Use other channels for evergreen content or when users don't need to take immediate action.

### HMS IT website

The HMS IT website focuses on serving users who have two primary goals:

- **Get help from the service desk**
- **Learn about and access services**

Landing pages for specific services guide users to essential features while linking to external resources.

Moreover, the website contains:

- **General information** about essential services, such as email accounts and wireless network access
- **News articles** for changes and updates, as a version of messages sent as broadcast email or as updates that stand on their own when a broadcast email isn’t necessary
- **Events**
- Information about the **internal organization**, including team members and department structures

### Knowledge base

The knowledge base is where specific details about software or services reside. Articles in the knowledge base fall into four categories:

- **How-to guide** – Solutions for one specific, real-world user problem.
- **Tutorial** – Introductions for new users, focusing on teaching.
- **Reference** – Comprehensive lists of options, policies, and details.
- **Background information** – This covers how a service is configured. The audience is typically HMS IT staff.

The knowledge base is only used to provide guidance when support from the vendor is not available or when a process has steps unique to HMS that are not covered in vendor resources.

#### When to create a knowledge base article

Before creating a new knowledge base article, confirm that the information is:

- Needed by the community
- Not already provided by HMS IT, HUIT, or other trusted sources
- Appropriate for the knowledge base

##### Recognize the cost of documentation

The commitment to clear, consistent, and correct documentation is significant. Beyond the initial drafting and editing, staff must keep the resource current as services and processes change. **Use this document to help verify that documentation is necessary and that a knowledge base article is the best format before creating an article.** Limiting the documentation to only what is needed makes maintenance more manageable and makes the content more findable.

##### Fulfill important user needs

**Create documentation that meets a proven user need.** Create new articles after reviewing the community's real-world issues or requests for information. One way to verify these issues is by looking at the frequency and type of tickets submitted to the support desk. Search activity — on the HMS IT website or the knowledge base itself — is also a good indicator. Additional user research methods may also reveal a need for documentation.

##### Review existing resources

When you have identified a verifiable user need, **consider all the opportunities a user has to find information** before committing to a new knowledge base article for HMS IT. Typically, if documentation already exists, a new knowledge base article doesn't need to be written.

###### Internal resources

**Search for existing documentation in the HMS IT knowledge base, the HMS IT website, and online resources from HUIT.** If documentation already exists for the issue, a new article isn't needed. If the information resides within a lengthy knowledge base article, consider splitting the existing article into several new, specific articles.

###### External resources

Users most commonly begin their search with Google. **Review the top search results for an issue to see if the information is available on an external site.** The support center on the website of a service often has excellent documentation. A knowledge base article isn't needed if a user can find authoritative documentation with a Google search.

##### Consider the context

Users visit knowledge bases with specific needs and expectations. They need help, and they expect help articles. **We can meet the needs and expectations of users by providing information in a format familiar to them.**

The types of documentation most appropriate for a knowledge base article include:

- Reference document
- How-to guide
- Educational tutorial
- Background information

If the article you are considering doesn't align with one of these primary types, consider other options.
