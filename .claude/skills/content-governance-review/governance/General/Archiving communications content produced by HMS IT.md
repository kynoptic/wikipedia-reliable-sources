# Archiving communications content produced by HMS IT

These guidelines are based on recommendations from staff at Records Management Services at the Harvard University Archives.

1. **Emails to the HMS community** – Messages about IT issues, outage notifications, and notifications of significant service changes sent broadly to the community or to users of a service.
- Apply **Systems Technical Support Records (0925**) – “Retain 2 years after creation, then destroy securely”.
1. Content on the [HMS IT website](https://it.hms.harvard.edu/) – Information on service offerings, account management, information security requirements, and recommendations.
- The HMS website is annually crawled using the web archiving tool Archive-It, so any public facing content will be archived.
1. Documentation on our [knowledge base](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__harvardmed.service-2Dnow.com_stat-3Fid-3Dstat-5Fknowledge&d=DwMFaQ&c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&r=0KOKUXcBt1nJ2ZnQr4P9VUxHiQfCqgi1pJWYGA8LPs0&m=yPGyP9htX1M5vz-YGGayGBYQnBrrzxoYVJDDczVgg0kq0XK_zy2GTXTOZA2pZNX6&s=0GYqYymti1YWlHhb3MEkeNdCUO8do-ApdBrZ3ZMJ40o&e=) – Tool-specific guidance, technical support, tutorials, and technical documentation for HMS users and IT staff.
- This falls under HU General Records Schedule **Systems Documentation Records (0870)**.
- This is also a site that Archive-It could crawl.
1. **Comms governance on the SharePoint intranet** – Internal communications guidelines, governance documents, process documentation, and style guides.
- Depending on the type of documentation, these could fall under GRS **Procedure Records (1127)** or **Policy Records (1125)**.
1. **Communications working group folders in OneDrive** – Drafts, works-in-progress, meeting minutes, and other committee-specific materials. These are working groups, not committees, so 1030 would apply.
- If it is a standing committee, they fall under GRS **Standing Committee Records (1027)**. The files would then need to come to the archives 10 years after creation.
- If it’s not a standing committee, then they fall under GRS **Committee Records (1030)** and they would still be transferred to the archives, but after the committee has been.
