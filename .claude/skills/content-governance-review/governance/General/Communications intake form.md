# Communications intake form

*This form streamlines the intake process by capturing all essential details for clear and effective communication for email, the HMS IT website, and KB articles*

## Introduction

This form provides a standardized template for collecting essential details to plan and draft accurate, timely, and user-focused communications for the HMS community.

Designed for anyone responsible for notifying end-users — via email, web content, knowledge base articles, or printed materials — this form ensures that all relevant information is gathered early in the communication planning process.

By capturing key information about user impact, affected audiences, required actions, and the subject matter expert who should review content, the form helps reduce confusion and ensures consistency. Incomplete or inconsistent information can delay approval processes and compromise message clarity; this tool mitigates that risk and supports efficient, high-quality communication.
