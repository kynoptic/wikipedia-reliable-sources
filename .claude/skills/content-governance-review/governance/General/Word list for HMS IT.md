## Summary

Here are some general guidelines and themes across entries:

- **Use plain, everyday language** – Avoid jargon.
- **Use the full, official name** – While there are some practical exceptions (like *HMS IT*), use the full name of a software or service to reduce confusion and enhance professionalism.
- **Avoid insensitive or morbid terms** – Do not use terms like *master* and *slave* or *end-of-life*. Use inclusive and accessible language, employing gender-neutral terms (like *they*) and describing human–computer interactions to accommodate different input devices (for example, use *select* instead of *click*).
- **Avoid unnecessary punctuation and Latin abbreviations** – Do not use exclamations, rhetorical questions, *(s)* to accommodate both plural and singular forms, and */* as a conjunction (as in *either/or*). Avoid Latin abbreviations (like *etc.*or *i.e*.).

- Other words to look out for include:
- application
- machine
- please
- PC
- should
