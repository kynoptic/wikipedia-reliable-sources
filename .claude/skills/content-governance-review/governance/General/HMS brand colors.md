# HMS brand colors

Harvard Medical School has created three different color palettes with primary, secondary, and accent colors to allow you to combine and create elegant color combinations of your own. Primary colors feature the famous Harvard Crimson and Ink colors, which should be the main focus and can be built upon. Secondary colors are to be used as neutrals to allow the primary colors to be the main focus. Accent colors are to be used for highlighting important information.

## Primary colors

Within our color palette, we have two primary colors that are used: Harvard Crimson and Black.

## Secondary colors

The secondary palette provides a neutral field against which the primary colors can live.
