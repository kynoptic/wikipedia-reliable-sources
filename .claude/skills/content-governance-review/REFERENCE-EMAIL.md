## Subject line guidelines

**Core principles:**
1. **Clearly summarize the main point** - Help recipients determine relevance
2. **Include date if necessary** - Indicate urgency or timeline
3. **Keep concise** - Email clients may truncate long subject lines
4. **Use sentence case** - More readable and highlights proper nouns
5. **Prefix reminders** - Use "Reminder:" for follow-up communications
6. **Avoid "please"** - Focus on conveying the central message
7. **Use directives for action** - Start with verb and include brief explanation

**Examples:**
- Webex will be unavailable June 8-9
- Reminder: Update Zoom before May 30
- Network interruptions on June 27 impacting services
- Install CrowdStrike to protect against security risks

## Salutation guidelines

**Format:** `Dear [Subject Noun] of [Organization]:`

**Rules:**
- Use people-first language throughout
- Address recipients as precisely as possible
- Begin with main subject noun (Members, Staff, Users)
- Follow with organizational affiliation if relevant
- Use full department names (not acronyms)
- Start with "Dear" and end with colon (:)

**Examples:**
- Dear Members of the HMS and HSDM Communities:
- Dear Faculty Members of HMS:
- Dear Users of Webex at HMS and HSDM:
- Dear Faculty and Staff of the Harvard Program in Therapeutic Science (HiTS) and Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology (LSP):

## Body content architecture

### Content priority and messaging architecture

Structure messages in this order (bold the primary messages):

1. The benefit of the work to users
2. **When and what work will be done**
3. How that work impacts users
4. Why the user must act
5. **The actions we recommend the user take**

**Example:**
> [1] To increase bandwidth across campus, [2] **HMS IT will upgrade the network on Saturday, September 26, 2020, from 6:00 AM to 1:00 PM EDT (UTC-4).**
>
> [3] You may have trouble maintaining an internet connection during this time. [4] To limit the impact of this intermittent outage, [5] **save any work that uses an internet connection before the scheduled upgrade**.

### Complicated messages structure

For multifaceted impacts and variable recommended actions:

1. **Summary**
   - Benefit, when/what, impact, why act, and primary actions
2. **Additional actions users must take**
   - Secondary and tertiary actions
   - Important caveats or helpful information
3. **Elaborate on work and benefits**
   - Describe problem, solution, and outcome
4. **Additional information**
   - Links to overview pages
   - Links to relevant KB articles

## Avoiding phishing email patterns

**Critical requirements** to prevent acclimating community to phishing tactics:

**Sender and recipients:**
- Use address familiar to recipients (`*@hms.harvard.edu`)
- Don't communicate about services users don't use
- Address user directly (use "Dear First-name Last-name:" if possible)

**Links and URLs:**
- Avoid URL shorteners (they hide destinations)
- Describe external web properties when linking outside `harvard.edu`
  - Example: *You can read more on [Zoom's support site](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en)*
- Link text must describe destination
- Avoid "Click here" or similar vague phrases

**Tone and urgency:**
- Don't mention negative consequences if user doesn't act
  - Frame as positive results if user *does* act
- Distance negative outcomes from linked calls-to-action
- Avoid urgent action requests (give users several days minimum)
- Avoid intense language (*absolutely* and *immediately*)

**Security-sensitive patterns:**
- Don't include attachments
- Don't request account verification
- Don't request credentials or passwords
- Don't link directly to files that trigger downloads
