## Complete style guide

### Use a professional voice

Use a professional voice in all communications. The HMS IT community often searches IT content for information on using or fixing software and services. Users may be frustrated and confused, seeking quick solutions. Write with sensitivity to this context.

**Create helpful messages.** Provide clarity and understanding with professional and empathetic writing. Be formal, direct, and friendly. Write as a knowledgeable mentor, offering expert guidance with humanity and care.

**Be approachable and positive.** Communicate problems as opportunities and emphasize any positive aspects. Avoid humor, which may be insensitive to frustrated users and undermine professionalism and clarity.

**Provide clear instructions.** Give directives to help users achieve their goals.

**Avoid using *please* and *thank you***, as they can imply optional steps and cause confusion.

The voice of HMS IT communications must be:
- **Formal, but not stuffy**
- **Approachable, but not entertaining**
- **Polite, but not mannered**

### Write clearly and concisely

#### Use simple and understandable words

Use only words and phrases our readers understand to ensure accessibility and engagement. Reflect the language used by our audience and prefer familiar, shorter, or more straightforward terms. Refer to the word list for specific recommendations. Use contractions — they're shorter and more friendly than the expanded form.

Balance simplicity and familiarity with precision to prevent misunderstandings. If a word has multiple meanings, choose something more specific to avoid confusion. Define uncommon terms when introducing acronyms, abbreviations, or necessary but obscure terminology, explaining their meaning when the word first appears. Subsequent usage doesn't require a definition.

Avoid jargon, clichés, slang, idioms, and double-speak to promote inclusivity and clarity. Avoid discriminatory language. Don't ask rhetorical questions; instead, make statements. For example, change *Wondering how to access your email? Read these instructions to get started:* to *These instructions explain how to access your email:*.

Avoid abstract or subjective terms that can often be revised out of sentences. For example, *Configure the backup feature after installation* can be *Configure backups after installation*. Commonly unnecessary words include *feature*, *process*, *function*, *factor*, *area*, *condition*, *aspect*, and *degree*. Removing empty words makes the text more straightforward and concise.

#### Write direct and concise sentences

Write sentences that cover a single topic with fewer than 26 words to enhance readability. Break long, complex sentences into shorter ones. Avoid unnecessary wordiness to clarify concepts.

Avoid roundabout expressions. Condense common short phrases without losing their meaning. For example, *on a weekly basis* can be *weekly*, and *in the near future* can be *soon* or *shortly*. This makes the text more direct and efficient.

Avoid redundancies by not repeating words found in the preceding acronym and cutting needless words from common short phrases. For example, *macOS operating system* should be *macOS* and *join together* should be *join*. This keeps the text concise and focused.

Avoid unnecessary modifiers. Weak or overused modifiers rarely improve meaning, clarity, or impact. Words like *absolutely*, *actually*, *basically*, *completely*, *easily*, *particularly*, *simply*, *totally*, and *very* can usually be removed without changing the sentence's importance. This strengthens the sentence.

Avoid nominalizations and weak verbs. Nominalization turns a strong verb into a phrase with a noun and a weak verb. For example, revise *When a search is performed, the system undergoes an evaluation of the records* to *When you search, the system evaluates the records*. Using strong verbs makes writing more dynamic and easier to understand.

#### Write positively

Avoid double negatives. Rewrite negative expressions to be positive where practical. For example, *not without* can be *has*, and *isn't impossible* can be *is possible*. Positive statements are clearer and more direct.

#### Use active voice

Use the active voice to clarify who or what acts. The passive voice is sometimes clearer and more natural, but it is often needlessly wordy and indirect. For example, *The software installation must be carried out by an administrator* should be *An administrator must install the software*. Active voice makes sentences clearer and more engaging.

#### Use present tense and imperative mood

Use the present tense when giving instructions, as the user follows along in real-time. Write in the second-person imperative mood to address the reader directly and tell them what to do. The second-person imperative mood uses *you* and command verbs to create direct and clear instructions. For example, instead of saying *The software should be installed by you*, say *Install the software*. This creates a sense of immediacy and directness, making instructions easier to follow.

#### Use the Oxford comma

Use the Oxford comma, also called the serial comma, before the last item in a list to help reduce ambiguity. The Oxford comma clarifies the separation of items in a list, preventing potential misinterpretation.

#### Write short and well-structured paragraphs

Use the paragraph form by default to structure content within sections. Paragraphs help the reader navigate the document and strengthen the impact of other formats like lists, tables, and screenshots. Use the paragraph form as the foundation of your message.

Address only one topic per paragraph to organize information effectively. Write paragraphs that are six sentences or shorter; three to four sentences per paragraph are ideal. Start each paragraph with a topic sentence to make navigating the text easier for the reader. Use a linking sentence to transition from the previous paragraph if a transition clarifies the connection between the two paragraphs.

#### Break content into sections

Organize your document so users can quickly orient themselves and find the necessary information. Users rarely read a page from start to finish; they skim to find relevant information. Even if they must read the entire document to accomplish a task, they will review it to ensure they are in the right place.

Help users understand the content by breaking it into logical sections with descriptive headers. Vary the content using paragraphs, notices, and lists to make the document easier to skim.

Keep introductory material short. Users will likely skip introductions, so get right to the point with only a sentence or two to elaborate on the title and short description or explain what the document will help the user do.

### Format text consistently

#### Use short, descriptive, action-oriented titles and headings

Clear titles and headings help users find what they are looking for and increase their confidence in the message's relevance. Use short and descriptive headings. Users typically try to accomplish a task, so use action words in titles and headings. Avoid the FAQ format.

**Use sentence case in titles and headings.** Sentence case is easier to read and makes it easier to identify capitalized programs and services that users frequently seek.

Avoid vague headings like *Introduction*, *More information*, or *Step two*. Be as specific as possible in labeling.

Write headings with parallel phrasing. Headings that follow a consistent pattern are more comfortable to follow. Try to make them around the same length and have them follow the same kind of phrasing.

Also, avoid stacked headings by introducing a new section with prose before jumping to a subsection. Prefer fewer levels of headings to keep the document clear and navigable. Avoid numbering headings.

#### Format dates and times consistently

Spell out dates and times on the first usage in a document, using the format "Wednesday, January 1, 2020, at 3:30 PM EDT (UTC-4)."

Include the minutes even if a time lands directly on the hour, as in *7:00 AM*. Only use *7 AM* when space is limited. Write out *noon* and *midnight*. Avoid *12:00 PM* and *12:00 AM*.

**Specify the time zone:**
- **EST (UTC-5)** – Use from the first Sunday of November to the second Sunday of March
- **EDT (UTC-4)** – Use from the second Sunday of March to the first Sunday of November

#### Use lists effectively

Draw attention and make messages easier to skim by using lists. However, avoid overusing lists. They are most effective when integrated into the document appropriately.

- **Use lists for multiple items or steps** – Describe two or three simple items within a sentence rather than breaking them into a list
- **Limit the number of list items** – Split lists of ten or more items into separate sections
- **Introduce lists with context** – Use introductory text to contextualize the list and orient the reader
- **Choose the correct list type** – Use bullets for lists where the order of items does not matter; use numbered lists when the order is important
- **Refer to steps by their content, not number** – Numbers may change as instructions are updated
- **Maintain parallel phrasing and formatting** – Ensure items in a list are similar in length and form
- **Use periods appropriately** – End list items with a period if any item is a complete sentence
- **Describe one user action per step** – Do not combine several activities in a single list item

#### Use consistent capitalization

**Sentence case**: Capitalize the first word of the sentence and proper nouns. Use sentence case as the default for most text. Apply sentence case to titles, headings, navigation text, and acronyms that are not proper nouns.

**Title case**: Capitalize the first letter of each word. Use title case for proper nouns, such as names of companies and applications, product components, team names, job titles, and published works.

**All caps**: Use all caps sparingly, primarily for port names, first-level registry subtrees, acronyms, and user input variables. Do not use all caps for emphasis.

**Lowercase**: Certain text should always be lowercase, even at the start of a sentence. This includes file extensions and URLs.

#### Use monospace, bold, and italics

Use **monospace** formatting for:
- Code from any programming language
- User inputs and keypresses
- Computer outputs and error messages
- Directories, file names, and IP addresses
- Text where individual characters must be legible

Use **bold** to highlight UI elements and important phrases or sentences.

Use **italics** for:
- Emphasis
- Offsetting variables
- Citing full-length works
- Referring to specific letters or words

Use straight quotes (") instead of curly quotes (",") for quotations and when citing shorter works. Always place punctuation outside of quotes.

#### Use notices to draw attention

Use notices when bold text inline does not draw sufficient attention:

- **Note** – Use this notice for information that may improve a process or clarify when there is a high likelihood of confusion
- **⚠️ Caution** – Use this notice when users might lose data, face a security risk, or cause problems that are difficult to correct

#### Use tables for tabular data only

**Avoid using tables solely for layout changes.** Tables used for design purposes can make the document inaccessible. Use tables to display tabular data or when no other logical format fits.

Follow these guidelines:
- **Use accessible HTML tables** – Tables must be presented in HTML format
- **Introduce tables with explanatory text** – Provide context before the table
- **Include a descriptive heading row** – Label each column clearly
- **Add any measurements in the heading, not in each cell**
- **Align content appropriately** – Left-align text and right-align numerical data
