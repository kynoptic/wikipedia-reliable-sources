# Wikipedia Goggles

This repository hosts two [Brave Search Goggles](https://github.com/brave/goggles-quickstart) that reranks search results to promote sources considered reliable by the Wikipedia community:

1. **`wikipedia-reliable-sources-only.goggle`** – Boosts reliable sources and downranks contentious ones, showing no other results. [Search using this Goggle](https://search.brave.com/goggles?goggles_id=https%253A%252F%252Fraw.githubusercontent.com%252Fkynoptic%252Fwikipedia-reliable-sources%252Fmain%252Fwikipedia-reliable-sources-only.goggle).
2. **`wikipedia-reliable-sources.goggle`** – Similar to the first, but it allows additional sources while discarding those deemed unreliable.

## Reliability sources

This project leverages reliability ratings from various Wikipedia sources to assess the trustworthiness of content. The ratings are based on the following Wikipedia pages:

- [Reliable sources/Perennial sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Perennial_sources)
- [WikiProject Video games/Sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Video_games/Sources)
- [WikiProject Film/Resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Film/Resources)
- [WikiProject Albums/Sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Albums/Sources)
- [WikiProject Christian music/Sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Christian_music/Sources)
- [WikiProject Professional wrestling/Sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Professional_wrestling/Sources)
- [WikiProject Korea/Reliable sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Korea/Reliable_sources)

Additionally, sources frequently used in featured articles (FA) and good articles (GA) are included.

## How reliability affects rankings

The reliability ratings are adjusted using the following parameters:

- `$boost=2` – Applied to sources considered "Generally reliable" or "Reliable"
- `$downrank=2` – Used for sources labeled with "No consensus"
- `$discard` – Assigned to sources determined as "Unreliable," "Blacklisted," or "Deprecated"

## Extracting perennial sources

Run `scripts/fetch_perennial_sources.py` to download and parse the perennial
sources list from Wikipedia. The script outputs a `perennial_sources.json` file
containing structured records.

```bash
python scripts/fetch_perennial_sources.py
```
