# Version control and commit standards

- Track all source code, configuration, and setup files in Git.
- Commit in small, logical units that represent one focused change.
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for clarity (e.g. `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`).
- Create feature branches for all changes; never push directly to `main` or `production`.
- Rebase or squash commits before merging to maintain a clean history.
- Include setup or migration scripts when adding new systems or flows.
