# Mindset and communication principles

- Think in terms of user behavior when writing features and tests.
- Prioritize adaptability and clarity over "perfect" architecture.
- Maintain short feedback loops: fast tests, reliable CI, clear logs.
- **Respect quality gates: tests and lints exist to help, not hinder.** Never bypass them without explicit permission.
- Ask questions early when requirements are unclear; don't guess.
- Document and surface technical debt deliberately.
- Keep pull requests small, focused, and easy to review or revert.
- Write code with empathy for future maintainers—including your future self.
