# Instructions for contributors

After every commit:
1. Open `docs/roadmap.md`.
2. Mark any completed tasks or deliverables with `[x]` checkboxes.
3. Add new unchecked boxes for important follow-up work.
4. If everything on the roadmap is essentially finished, suggest fresh items to pursue.

Always keep the roadmap in sync with repository progress.
